# Dice-Game
#### Description
The Dice Game is basically a simple game designed for two player's. Based on the rules of the game, the winner will be decided. And if player's are unaware of the game rules, then they can easily understand the rules which have been provided in the UI  by clicking the "Rules" which has been placed in the top left corner of the UI. By clicking the "Rules", a dialog box will pop up on the screen which is implemented by using Sweetalert library, inorder to avoid the traditional default design of dialog boxes and alert boxes, to make it more interactive for the user's/player's. In the dialog box the game rules are mentioned clearly for player's understanding. <br />
